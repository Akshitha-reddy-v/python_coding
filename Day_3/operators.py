# Operators - perform operations on the values.

# Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/)
a = 5
b = 7.4
c = a + b    # c holds 12.4
d = a - b    # d holds -2.4
e = a * b    # e holds 37.0
f = a / b    # f holds 0.6756756756756757

# Modulo Operator (%) - gives the remainder of a division.
# usually used to know whether a number is even or odd
g = 5
f = 8
h = g % 2  # h holds 1
i = f % 3  # i holds 2

# Arithmetic shortcuts (+=,-=,*=,/=)
j = 4
j = j + 2  # j holds 6
j += 2     # also holds 6

# Comparision Operators (==,!=,>,<,>=,<=) - used to compare two operands.
k = 5
l = 10
m = k > l  # m holds False and hence it is boolean type.
